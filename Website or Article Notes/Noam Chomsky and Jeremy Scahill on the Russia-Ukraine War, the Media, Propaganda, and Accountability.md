# Notes
- "Biden has officially accused Putin of war crimes and suggested he should face a “war crime trial.” Russia, [like the U.S.](https://theintercept.com/2021/08/23/samantha-power-icc-sudan/), has steadfastly refused to ratify the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, so it is unclear how or where the administration believes such a trial would take place.""
