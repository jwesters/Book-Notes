# Notes
* **What Trauma Is Not** 
	Most of us have heard someone, perhaps ourselves, say something like “Oh  my God, that movie ast night was so disturbing, I left the theater traumatized.” Or we’ve read a (typically dismissive) news story about university students agitating for “content warnings” lest they be “retraumatized” by what they hear. In all these cases, the usage is understandable but misplaced; what people are actually referring to in these cases is stress, physical and/or emotional. As Peter Levine aptly points out, “Certainly, all traumatic events are stressful, but not all stressful events are traumatic.” (Levine, Healing Trauma Study Guide, 7)  (pg. 37)

* I would have thus exhibited what is called response flexibility: the ability to choose how we address life’s inevitable ups and downs, its disappointments, triumphs, and challenges. “Human freedom involves our capacity to pause between stimulus and response and, in that pause, to choose the one response toward which we wish to throw our weight,” wrote the psychologist Rollo May. [12] Trauma robs us of that freedom. (Rollo May, The Courage to Create (New York: W. W. Norton, 1975), 100.) (pg. 41)

* The news gets better: seeing trauma as an internal dynamic grants us much-needed agency. If we treat trauma as an external event, something that happens to or around us, then it becomes a piece of history we can never dislodge. If, on the other hand, trauma is what took place inside us as a result of what happened, in the sense of wounding or disconnection, then healing and reconnection become tangible possibilities. Trying to keep awareness of trauma at bay hobbles our capacity to know ourselves. (pg. 46)

* Unless we can measure something, science won’t concede it exists, which is why science refuses to deal with such “nonthings” as the emotions, the mind, the soul, or the spirit. —Candace Pert, Ph.D., Molecules of Emotion (pg. 38)

* Again, it’s all one: emotions affect nerves and vice versa; nerves act on hormones; hormones on the immune system; the immune system on the brain; the brain on the gut; the gut on the brain; and all of these act on the heart, and vice versa. In turn, our bodies influence our brains and minds and, necessarily, the brains, minds, and bodies of others. (pg. 64)

* Mari Swingle treats many youths with troubled behavior, attention issues, and addictive patterns. A neuropsychologist, she is the author of perhaps the most comprehensive book on the brain and the digital culture, iMinds: How and Why Constant Connectivity Is Rewiring Our Brains and What to Do About It. “We’re seeing autistic-like characteristics in children without autism,” she told me. “Lack of smile response, delayed verbal skills, what I used to affectionately call ‘busy children’: now these are just kids that are kind of running around aimlessly or conversely zombified when they’re not on the tech . . . You have kids—for that matter, adults now —that are used to being on the tech for extensive periods of time. A walk won’t do it, canoeing won’t do it, even speed skateboarding—a lot of things —skiing, even those are now challenged.” Dr. Swingle, too, is very concerned about the impacts of relentless screen exposure on brain development: “Less ability to focus on the normal, the baseline, including states of observation, contemplation, and transitions from which ideas spark —what many under the age of twenty now consider a void, proclaiming boredom  .  .  . On a biological as well as a cultural level, such brain state changes affect learning, socialization, recreation, partnering, parenting, and creativity—in essence all factors that make a society and a culture. The neurophysiological processes that regulate mood and behavior are deregulating.” (Mari Swingle, i-Minds: How and Why Constant Connectivity Is Rewiring Our Brains and What to Do About It (New Society, 2019), 11, 185) (pgs 180-181)

* Or consider the DSM-5 diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), often tacked on to ADHD and other “diseases.” “If your child or teenager has a frequent and persistent pattern of anger, irritability, arguing, defiance or vindictiveness toward you and other authority figures, he or she may have oppositional defiant disorder,” advises the Mayo Clinic.  The clue is in the word “toward”: oppositionality, by definition, can arise only in the context of a relationship. I can suffer symptoms of a cold in isolation, or break my ankle on my own. I cannot oppose anyone or be angry or irritable with anyone unless that “anyone” is in some relationship with me. “If you don’t believe me,” I sometimes tell audiences of therapists, parents, teachers, or medical professionals, “just lock yourself in your room tonight, make sure you are absolutely alone, and oppose somebody. If you succeed, put it on YouTube—it’ll go viral in no time.” 
  
   Given that a child develops in the context of relationships, her behavior will be intelligible to us only if we look at the relational environment. Seen this way, these so-called ODD kids turn out to be ones who lack sufficient connection with nurturing adults and have a natural resistance to being controlled by people they do not fully trust or feel close enough to. This aversion, furthermore, is only magnified by all attempts to shame or cajole it into submission. To call this “disordered” says nothing about the child’s inner experience; it reflects only the perspective of the ones who find his recalcitrance inconvenient. It is also completely obtuse about how emotional power dynamics work: there is nothing disordered in resisting authority figures that, for whatever reason, we do not feel confident in and safe with.(“Oppositional Defiant Disorder,” Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseasesconditions/oppositional-defiant-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20375831) (pgs 221-222)

* Let’s begin with something rather simple, now on the rise: depression, a state I know intimately. The word’s literal meaning is quite telling. To depress something means to push it down, as one might a beach ball in a swimming pool. I like that analogy especially because one can easily feel how much concerted force it takes to keep the ball submerged, and the way it “wants” to find a way back up to the surface. Keeping it down takes a toll. (pg. 231)

* Disconnection in all its guises—alienation, loneliness, loss of meaning, and dislocation—is becoming our culture’s most plentiful product. No wonder we are more addicted, chronically ill, and mentally disordered than ever before, enfeebled as we are by such malnourishment of mind, body, and soul. (pg. 268)

* This may sound grim. Yet the Buddha’s dictum offers a way out, since we remain the ones creating the world we see, the world we think is real, in every moment. And here is where healing comes in. We can do nothing about the world that created our mind, that may have instilled in us limiting, harmful, untrue beliefs about ourselves and others. However—and here’s the good news I alluded to—we can learn to be responsible for the mind with which we create our world moving forward. The capacity to heal is born of the willingness to do just that, to take on that responsibility. Such willingness is not a once-and-for-all declaration but a moment-by-moment commitment, one that can be regenerated when we lose touch with it. I, for one, have to keep reminding myself to do so. Nor is it an invitation to self-imposed naïveté or blithe so-called positive thinking. It is about the willingness to reconsider our entire view (pg. 327)
