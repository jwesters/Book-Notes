# Notes

* "At the Battle of Ypres, Canadian soldiers were among the first to suffer chlorine gas attacks. They peed into handkerchiefs; the ammonia in urine neutralized the active compounds in the gas."" — location:  ^ref-11034

* "To get Canadians super-stoked about the war, the government terrorized its own citizens with a prank invasion, dubbed "[If Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Day)".  In partnership with the Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan Company, the Canadian Forces staged a German invasion of Winnipeg in 1942 to "bring the war home." Actors in Nazi uniforms harassed citizens and simulated a firefight against real Canadian forces with fake bombings and threats of internment. Horrified citizens bought war bonds in droves, so the stunt was both successful and insane, somehow convincing people that Winnipeg was worth invading." — location: ^ref-56062

* "Canada's wartime government turned away most Jews fleeing Europe from 1930 to 1939. In 1939, more than 900 refugees on the [MS St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis) were rejected before they reached Halifax and sent back to Europe, where many were captured and killed by Germans." — location:  ^ref-25727

* "Canada realized something was wrong with the RCMP in July 1974 when [RCMP Constable Robert Samson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controversies_involving_the_Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police#Barn-burning_scandal) blew his fingers off while handling a faulty bomb. Samson admitted to planting the bomb, and at trial, he claimed he had been told to do "much worse" for the RCMP."" — location:  ^ref-64662

* "FORCED PEOPLE TO WATCH GAY PORN - In the 1950s and '60s the RCMP tried to root out all homosexuals in the civil service by strapping thousands of them into the "[fruit machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_machine_(homosexuality_test))" a device that pointed subjects' faces at photos of naked men and measured the dilation of their pupils." — location: ^ref-4121

* "In the 1950s and '60s, the RCMP regularly sent spies to [Tupperware](https://www.perlego.com/book/532459/whose-national-security-pdf) parties to root out freshness-obsessed anarchists."" — location:  ^ref-5603

* "No scandal has brought down a federal government since [1873](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Scandal), which must make each successive prime minister wonder just how much it's possible to get away with." — location:  ^ref-57272

* "[EHEALTH](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ehealth-scandal-a-1b-waste-auditor-1.808640) 166 people were awarded salaries over $100,000 to digitally convert all medical files for the Ontario government, and it still didn't happen." — location:  ^ref-9004

* "The meaninglessness of a Canadian apology has actually been enshrined in law.

* "[THE AIR INDIA BOMBING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) The most devastating terrorist attack in Canadian history killed all the passengers on Air India flight 182. And yet, Talwinder Parmar and Inderjit Reyat of the terrorist group Babbar Khalsa were only slightly less bumbling than CSIS and the RCMP, the law enforcement agencies who failed to stop them despite one million chances." — location: ^ref-15968

* "A nudist, antimaterialist splinter group of the Doukhobor sect of Russian Christians, [the Sons of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedomites) carried out a nude bombing campaign in western Canada from the 1920s through the 1950s. A nude bombing is like a regular bombing, only the person detonating the bomb is nude."" — location:  ^ref-24670

* "[The Squamish Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamish_Five) were a group of anarchist "urban guerrillas" from Vancouver in the 1980s. Their major caper was the bombing of a Toronto factory that manufactured cruise missile parts. The plan was to cripple the factory without hurting anybody, but they were bad at making bombs and their bomb went off early. Ten people were injured, while the factory itself was more or less unscathed. Before their arrest, the Squamish Five also firebombed several pornography stores in an attempt to end pornography for all time. — location:  ^ref-50548
