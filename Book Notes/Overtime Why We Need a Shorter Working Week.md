# Notes

“The free time that we enjoy in much of the Global North is the result of victories achieved by workers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was the Australian stonemasons that first won the eight-hour day in 1856.” (pg. 1) 

	  The stonemasons in Australia were preceded marginally by Samuel Parnell in 
    Aotearoa (New Zealand), a carpenter who won an eight-hour day from his 
    employer in early 1840.)


"Research has shown that over time and across the globe, a higher capital share (and lower labour share) is linked with higher inequality in terms of the distribution of personal incomes. As it stands in the UK, around 12 per cent of the population own 50 per cent of private wealth. Unsurprisingly, some are calling this new economy ‘rentier capitalism’, where those who inherit wealth or simply own assets thrive and where ‘work does not pay’ for the many." (pg. 5)

"Workers are getting a raw deal in more subtle ways too. They put in large amounts of unpaid overtime; are commuting for longer than they were even just ten years ago; are earning less in real terms than they have for over a decade;14 and are suffering remarkable levels of in-work poverty. The number of precarious jobs – those that cannot guarantee a secure livelihood – has risen sharply this century, with over 1 million zero-hours contracts deployed in 2017 and bogus ‘self-employment’ taking basic rights away from workers" (pg. 6)

"David Frayne calls this the ‘employment dogma’, which often makes a link between employment and good health being somehow natural or innate to human flourishing. What’s clear from history, however, is that without significant collective organising and political regulation, the labour market fails in delivering a robust mechanism for economic security and freedom to all.""

"It has been over eighty years since President Roosevelt’s New Deal put hours caps into legislation in the US and over seventy since the UK established the forty-hour work week as the new standard. Since then, the world has changed rapidly. New technologies and business strategies have moulded our workplaces and lives, economic ideologies have replaced one another in turn, and yet our working hours have remained largely the same or have even increased." (pg. 11)

"In 1912, during one of the high points of struggle for the British labour movement, the Unofficial Reform Committee of the South Wales Miners issued a powerful manifesto outlining what the authors, including the miner and trade union leader Noah Ablett together with A. J. Cook, William Henry Mainwaring and others, saw as the path for the future development of the mining industry. The manifesto speaks with a determination and a utopian hope that can still stir our own desires for a world beyond toil and drudgery even today. Yet, there is one striking aspect to it, one that may seem anachronistic. In its spirited mixture of Marxism and Syndicalism, it calls not merely for better jobs, but instead issues a demand for a future where we are no longer forced to work for a wage at all." (pg. 14)

"The fight for free time has accompanied capitalism ever since its emergence around four hundred years ago. But why? Why is time such an important terrain of conflict, negotiation and contestation? A large part of the answer lies in the way in which our economies function at the most basic level. We are no longer in Eric Hobsbawm’s ‘Age of Capital’ from where the traditional images of gruelling work conditions – with their attendant long, grinding hours of labour – often stem. Yet time, and our lack of it, remains an important issue, even in a world of technological marvels and vast national wealth." (pg. 14)

"Even our lives outside of the home can come under scrutiny in the world of private government. If this sounds like far-fetched scaremongering, it isn’t. Henry Ford famously set a precedent when he established a ‘Sociological Department’ at Ford in order to monitor his workforce’s household cleanliness, their diets, their drinking habits and more. Today, similar initiatives are not uncommon: under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), for example, US employers can impose penalties on those workers who do not comply with wellness programmes, which sometimes prescribe exercise and abstinence from alcohol."

"With new technology have come vast reductions in human labour time. Between 1870 and 1930 (when Keynes was writing), over 400 hours had been knocked off the average working year in the UK, equal to over seven hours taken off each working week. For Keynes, the meaning of this trend was clear: with growth continuing at this pace, fewer and fewer human hours were required to produce the things we needed, and the working week would continue to shrink, perhaps to around fifteen hours by the year 2030."

Even the acknowledged – and consistently misinterpreted – father of modern economics, Adam Smith, was well aware of what the division, and standardisation, of tasks did to us as humans. Alongside making us more productive as workers, he warns that ‘[t]he man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has not occasion to exert his understanding.’ (pg. 37)

However, in 1918 Lenin had modified his views in the context of post-revolutionary Russia, writing in the magazine Pravda that:

"We should try out every scientific and progressive suggestion of the Taylor system … the Taylor System, as well as all progressive measures of capitalism, combine the refined cruelty of bourgeois exploitation and a number of most valuable scientific attainments in the analysis of mechanical motions during work."

Taylorist control over workers is indeed a capitalist tool or coercion, but, Lenin writes, if ‘properly controlled and intelligently applied by the working people themselves’ it could become a crucial foundation of socialism. For socialist modernists like Lenin,

"Socialism is seen as a new mode of politically administering and economically regulating the same industrial mode of producing to which capitalism gave rise; it is thought to be a social form of distribution that is not only more just, but also more adequate to industrial production."  (pg. 43)

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that in 2016, women in the UK carried out 60 per cent more unpaid work than men.  The same study also revealed that women provided 74 per cent of all child-care time and spent, on average, twenty-six hours a week doing unpaid domestic labour. Men, in comparison, spend sixteen hours a week doing such unpaid work. This is what sociologists have referred to as the second and third shifts: the structural way in which women are disproportionately burdened with having to engage in paid employment, domestic labour and emotional care work. (pg. 57)

	Arlie Hochschild coined the term ‘the second shift’ in her 1989 book entitled The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. Duncombe and Marsden identify the ‘triple shift’ of women as constituting the burden of paid employment, domestic labour and tending to the emotional care of family members and loved ones: ‘Women’s “Triple Shift” (Gender and Emotional Work in Families)’, Sociology Review 4: 4, 1995, 30.

Multiplying the going market rate of these labours by the amount of unpaid hours recorded by the UK population, ‘yields an estimate of the total value of time devoted to unpaid work of about £26 billion in 1975 and £449 billion in 2015, respectively’. This means that a staggering 25 per cent of UK GDP is simply made up of the shadow labours of the home, and that is not including the cost of the raw materials of this work and other intermediary goods. (pg. 60)

	The ONS offered an estimate in 2018 of the total value of unpaid work including intermediary goods, raw materials and so on of £1.24 trillion, or 63.1 per cent per cent of national GDP (larger in size than the UK’s non-financial corporation sector).

	Such accounting is a political tool. In Federici’s words: ‘In this respect nothing can be more effective than to show that our female virtues have already a calculable money value: until today only for capital, increased in the measure that we were defeated, from now on, against capital, for us, in the measure that we organize our power’ (Revolution at Point Zero, p. 20).

Just a single example, the German ‘Kurzarbeit’ programme gives a picture of the extraordinary topicality of such schemes. This enabled a temporary reduction of regular working hours in response to substantial decreases in demand for labour within a firm. During the crisis, the scheme provided workers whose hours have been reduced with a minimum of 60 per cent of their lost pay. The IMF has described the policy as the ‘the gold standard of such programs’ worldwide (pg. 83-84)

In the UK, the working time reductions of 1847 were rescinded as soon as conditions improved, and it wasn’t until nearly thirty years later that the legislation for a maximum ten-hour day was finally secured (pg. 85)

One contemporary social movement that addresses climate injustice through direct action is Extinction Rebellion (XR). Since the protests held in London in November 2018, where XR blocked several of the main routes across the River Thames in an attempt to bring the capital to a halt, XR has deployed civil disobedience tactics with the aim to not only shut down major infrastructure and cause as much disruption as possible, but also actively court mass arrests from the police. While we don’t intend to assess the merits or pitfalls of XR’s strategic form of direct action, it appears that one of the reasons for the recent loss in public support for the campaign stems from its inability to articulate a strategic vision beyond what it is against. As the failings of Climate Camp and Occupy demonstrate, it is not enough to simply suspend the normal running of things. Political demands need to express forms of class struggle that engage with and stimulate not only people’s sense of injustice, but also their sense of a better future – one that directly speaks to improving their day-to-day lives. (pgs. 86-87)

	In an interview with The Guardian, Roger Hallam, one of XR’s founders, outlines the logic of the strategic approach taken regarding mass arrests: ‘only through disruption, the breaking of laws, do you get the attention you need … only through sacrifice – the willingness to be arrested and go to prison – do people take seriously what you are saying. And … only through being respectful to ourselves, the public and the police, do we change the hearts and minds of our opponents’.

The demand for a shorter working week can therefore be a platform around which collective organising and strike action can coalesce. We saw this sort of galvanising effect in the events called the ‘Long Friday’ on 24 October 1975 in Iceland. On the first day of the UN decade for women, the women of Iceland collectively took the day off from both paid and unpaid work in order to demonstrate to the men of the island the economic and social injustice women faced in both the domestic and public workplace. Ninety per cent of Iceland’s women took part in the strike, with twenty rallies being held across the country (the largest being in Reykjavik, with 25,000 women in attendance – an incredible number for a population of just 220,000 people).

The political effects of this collective action were tangible and are still felt in the country today. A year after the event took place, Iceland passed the Gender Equality Act, outlawing sex discrimination in workplaces and schools. In addition, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, one of the campaign’s lead organisers, became the world’s first democratically elected female head of state. (pgs. 87-88)

	Today, similar initiatives exist, for example the Women’s Strike collective: womenstrike.org.uk.
