"Their abuse found further justification in 1952, when, in Korea, captured American pilots admitted on national radio that they’d sprayed the Korean countryside with illegal biological weapons. It was a confession so beyond the pale that the CIA blamed Communists: the POWs must have been “brainwashed.” The word, a literal translation of the Chinese xi nao, didn’t appear in English before 1950. It articulated a set of fears that had coalesced in postwar America. Soviets were using guile to force an evil philosophy on the world." — location: [4790]() 


"On August 2, 1962, West headed to Oklahoma City’s Lincoln Park Zoo, where he’d invited a crowd of eager onlookers to watch his latest test. To their delight, he’d secured an Asian elephant named Tusko, an exotic specimen in Oklahoma. West would attempt, he explained, to induce musth, “a form of madness” that occurred in male elephants during the rutting season. Musth caused violent behavioral changes. “Normally cooperative and tamable, the elephant now runs berserk for a period of about two weeks, during which time he may attack or destroy anything in his path,” West explained, claiming that whole villages had been wiped out by a single musthing animal. In his rage, the elephant secreted “a mysterious fluid,” brown and sticky, from his temporal gland. Could it prove medically useful? He intended to find out. His method was simple: he would simulate musth by injecting the elephant with a lot of LSD." — location: [5097]()
