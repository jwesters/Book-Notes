# Notes

"In short lesson extensions that serve to enhance the learning experience, children are encouraged to do the following:"  
 
- Learn how their brains react to emotions, so that they can bring themselves back to a neutral point  
- Take daily “brain breaks” and focus on breathing  
- Practice mindful sensing—exploring sight, taste, smell, hearing, and motion  
- Consider the differences between optimism and pessimism  
- Learn to savor happiness  
- Engage in practical problem-solving and critical thinking  
- Learn perspective and how to view differing results  
- Focus on compassion and empathy  
- Discover the importance of generosity and a sense of social responsibility  
- Perform random acts of kindness" (pg. XX5)
							
				

"There are five basic sets of competencies that make up what is defined as social-emotional intelligence:  

- Self-awareness: knowing what we think and feel, and how  thoughts and feelings influence actions and choices  
- Self-management: learning how to handle challenging emotions so that they don’t cause problems; being able to set goals and deal with obstacles  
- Responsible decision-making: being able to come up with solutions to problems and consider the consequences of actions on ourselves and others  
- Social awareness: understanding the thoughts, feelings, and perspectives of others and developing empathy  
- Relationship skills: being able to work through conflicts; having strong connections to other people but resisting negative peer pressure" (pg. 8)
								

**Areas of the Brain** 

![[Pasted image 20220113210217.png]]
   
- amygdala: an almond-shaped structure that acts like a Guard Dog in the brain  
- hippocampus: part of the limbic system that helps with memory and spatial navigation 
- limbic brain: also known as the emotional brain, a key area for emotions, long-term memory, and behavior  
- prefrontal cortex (PFC): the Wise Old Owl at the front of the brain, where our higher or critical thinking occurs  
- reptilian brain: the oldest part of our brain, also known as the “Stone Age brain,” manages our automatic responses such as eating and breathing  
- right and left hemisphere: the two halves of the cerebral brain, linked by the corpus allosum (pg. 12)
								
								
**Emotionally Hijacked:** 
- Calm down: Don’t do anything until your amygdala is off guard duty and your prefrontal cortex is functioning again.  
- Apologize: Tell your child, “I got hijacked and lost my mind. I’m sorry. It’s back now.”  
- Reestablish connection: With young ones, you can console and hug, or have them draw or write about how they feel. With older ones, you can discuss both your roles in what happened. (pgs. 49-50)
								
								
**"Fight or Flight" feelings:**
 - Sweating or shaking  
- Pounding heart  
- Feeling a tummyache or thinking she might throw up  
- Breathing faster  
- Feeling the urge to cry (pg. 57)
								
								
**Things Pessimists Say:**
"When something bad happens, pessimists tell themselves the three Ps:""
- They introduce the **personal** by saying, “It’s all my fault.”  
- They bring on the **permanent** by thinking, “It’s always like this.”  
- They add the **pervasive** with thoughts like, “Everything is terrible.” (pg. 124)
								
								
**Fear:**  "Of all the emotions, fear is the one most strongly activated by the amygdala. It  is constantly scanning the environment for problems or threats of any kind, ready to turn on the stress response."

"It is well noted that anger is only fear in disguise. Take notice next time and see if the things we’re frightened of or defensive about often make us angry" (pg. 155)
