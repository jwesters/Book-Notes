	"There’s an essay called “What the Frog’s Eye Tells the Frog’s Brain,” by Warren McCulloch, who discovered that a frog’s eyes don’t work like ours. Ours are always moving: we blink, we scan. We move our heads. But a frog fixes its eyes on a scene and leaves them there. It stops seeing all the static parts of the environment, which become invisible, but as soon as one element moves, which could be what it wants to eat – the fly – it is seen in very high contrast to the rest of the environment. It’s the only thing the frog sees and the tongue comes out and takes it. Well, I realized that what happens with the Reich piece is that our ears behave like a frog’s eyes. Since the material is common to both tapes, what you begin to notice are not the repeating parts but the sort of ephemeral interference patterns between them. Your ear telescopes into more and more fine detail until you’re hearing what to me seems like atoms of sound. That piece absolutely thrilled me, because I realized then that I understood what minimalism was about. The creative operation is listening. It isn’t just a question of a presentation feeding into a passive audience. People will sometimes say about Reich’s piece, “Oh yes, that one with that voice which keeps hammering into your head,” and indeed, if you’re not especially listening to it that’s exactly what it is.""

	"Now, until one became accustomed to this fifty-odd note cluster, the resultant sound was fairly boring. But after that first ten minutes, it became progressively more absorbing. This was reflected in the rate at which people left the room – those who didn’t leave within ten minutes stayed for the whole performance. One began to notice the most minute variations from one crash to the next. The subtraction of one note by the right elbow missing its top key was immediately and dramatically obvious. The slight variations of timing became major compositional changes, and the constant changes within the odd beat frequencies being formed by all the discords began to develop into melodic lines. This was, for me, a new use of the error principle and led me to codify a little law that has since informed much of my work – “Repetition is a form of change.""

"Eno’s expertise in the recording studio has been much sought-after since about 1975, and he has produced at least twenty-three albums on which he is not listed as one of the composers. His actual role as a producer has varied from that of being a simple recording engineer to that of being a de facto co-composer of the total sound. Again the types of music represented are diverse. Eno produced two albums for the Portsmouth Sinfonia, the “world’s worst symphony” – an ensemble founded on high camp satire consisting of non-musicians and musicians playing instruments they didn’t know how to play, stumbling through outrageously butchered versions of the classical repertoire. Eno created a record label himself, Obscure Records, which released eight albums in the 1970s. The Obscure philosophy, discussed by Eno in several statements, was essentially to aid in the dissemination of experimental music, the Obscure records included pieces by contemporary composers Gavin Bryars, Christopher Hobbs, John Adams, Max Eastley, John Cage, Jan Steele, Michael Nyman, the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, Tom Phillips, Fred Orton, and Harold Budd. Among the rock acts Eno has produced are John Cale, Robert Calvert, Talking Heads, Ultravox, Devo, and U2. Eno also produced the compilation No New York (documenting the New York punk scene of the late 1970s, with music by the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, and DNA), an album featuring the ethereal music of hammer dulcimer player Laraaji, and a record by the Ghanaian pop group Edikanfo."

	"Classical music works around a body of “refined” sounds – sounds that are separate from the sounds of the world, pure and musical. There is a sharp distinction between “music” and “noise,” just as there is a distinction between the musician and the audience. I like blurring those distinctions – I like to work with all the complex sounds on the way out to the horizon, to pure noise, like the hum of London. If you sit in Hyde Park just far enough away from the traffic so that you don’t perceive any of its specific details, you just hear the average of the whole thing. And it’s such a beautiful sound. For me that’s as good as going to a concert hall at night".

"Eno’s ideas about listening to the environment as music are shared by modern composer Pauline Oliveros, who has used such concepts as the basis of actual pieces. The instructions for the fifth of her Sonic Meditations (1974) read as follows: “Take a walk at night. Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears.” Sonic Meditations XVII is somewhat similar: “1. Enhance or paraphrase the auditory environment so perfectly that a listener cannot distinguish between the real sounds of the environment and the performed sounds. 2. Become performers by not performing.” (pg 43)

"Much of Eno’s essay consists of a discussion of examples of contemporary experimental music whose scores can be considered heuristic. Cornelius Cardew’s “Paragraph 7” (from The Great Learning) is the piece treated at greatest length.32 This is a vocal score in which considerable freedom is given to the performers in terms of which pitches to sing and how long to hold them. The overall effect is one of meditative calm and tranquility – a slowly shifting, complex yet not too dissonant chord with a sense of one central drone pitch. What fascinates Eno about “Paragraph 7” is how the score stipulates not a specific result, but a range of possible results, how it accomodates the instincts and respects the choices of performers of all levels of musical training, and how elements not inherent in the score become primary features of the sound (beat frequencies appear between different sustained sung notes, and the strongest pitch, which naturally evolves out of the minimal instructions, becomes the resonating frequency of the room itself, which will vary from performance to performance – the singers pick it up intuitively and gravitate towards it)" (pg. 59)

"Cardew’s “Paragraph 7,” Nyman’s 1-100, and Gavin Bryars’s Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet (another piece Eno treats briefly) share a quality that was beginning to surface in Eno’s own music around the time this essay was published: they give the sense of being music that “is a section from a hypothetical continuum {that is} not especially directional – it does not exhibit strong “progress” from one point (position, theme, statement, argument) to a resolution.”36 One cannot imagine a movement from a Beethoven symphony ending halfway through with a fadeout ending, but one can imagine any number of modern experimental pieces ending this way, since they give no sense of driving inexorably into the future along a developmental line."

"Mode. 1.) In general terms, a mode is simply a scale. Any set of pitches arranged in a consistent pattern and used as the basis of a piece of music can be considered a mode. 2.) In the specific sense of the word, a mode is one of eight “Church modes” recognized by music theorists in the 16th century. These modes are still in use, particularly the two that are equivalent to our modern major and minor scales. The Church modes were originally associated with specific tonics (D for Dorian, E for Phrygian, etc.), today they are freely transposed. 

In psychological terms, the modes can be rated on a “brightness/darkness index,” as in the following chart, where 1 stands for the brightest mode and 7 stands for the darkest: 

Ionian mode (major scale): C D E F G A B / Bright: 2 
Dorian mode: D E F G A B C / Somewhat dark: 4 
Phrygian mode: E F G A B C D / Very dark: 6 
Lydian mode: F G A B C D E / Very bright: 1 
Mixolydian mode: G A B C D E F / Fairly bright: 3 
Aeolian mode (minor scale): A B C D E F G / Dark: 5 
Locrian mode: B C D E F G A / Extremely dark: 7"
